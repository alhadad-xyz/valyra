{"body":"## 📖 General Description\nImplement the transition hold system where 90% of funds are released to the seller immediately upon completion, while 10% is held for a transition period.\n\n**Category:** Escrow Contract (`EscrowV1.sol`)\n\n**Technical Context:** On `releaseFunds()`: Calculate `amount90 = total * 90 / 100` and `amount10 = total - amount90`. Transfer `amount90` to seller immediately. Store `amount10` in `pendingRelease[seller] += amount10` with timestamp. Separate function `claimPending()` allows seller to claim after X days. Prevents rounding errors by calculating amount10 as remainder.\n\n\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] 90% released to Seller immediately\n- [ ] 10% held in `transitionEscrow`\n- [ ] Time-lock or Sign-off release for 10%\n- [ ] Math accuracy verified (no rounding loss)\n- [ ] Peer review completed\n\n## 🛠️ How to Implement\n1. **Math:** `amount90 = total * 90 / 100`, `amount10 = total - amount90`.\n2. **Transfer:** Send `amount90` to Seller immediately on release.\n3. **Hold:** Keep `amount10` in contract. Map `pendingRelease[seller] += amount10`.\n4. **Release:** Separate function `claimPending()` after X days.\n\n## 📚 References\n- 📄 [Product Requirements (PRD)](docs/prd.md)\n- 📐 [Technical Design Doc (TDD)](docs/tdd.md)\n- 🎨 [Design Specifications](docs/design-spec.md)"}
