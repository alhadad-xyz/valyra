*   **Buyers (Micro-Investors):** For individuals looking to acquire passive income assets instead of building from scratch, often referred to as "Micro-Private Equity."

## How It Makes Tasks Safer & Easier

Valyra replaces manual, high-friction processes with an **Autonomous M&A** experience:

### 1. Trustless Settlements
*   **The Problem:** In traditional forum-based sales (Facebook, Discord), buyers fear sending money first, and sellers fear handing over code first.
*   **The Valyra Solution:** A **Smart Escrow Vault** holds the funds (IDRX stablecoin) on-chain. Funds are only released to the seller once the buyer confirms they have successfully received and verified the assets.

### 2. AI-Powered Due Diligence
*   **The Problem:** Small buyers often lack the technical expertise to verify if a site's claims about traffic, revenue, or tech stack are true.
*   **The Valyra Solution:** **AI Agents** (via Coinbase AgentKit) "interview" the seller and automatically scan live sites, GitHub repositories, and analytics data. This creates a "Trust Score" and flags inconsistencies before a single dollar is committed.

### 3. Cryptographic Proof of Ownership
*   **The Problem:** "Bait-and-switch" scams where a seller shows one codebase but delivers another.
*   **The Valyra Solution:** **Build ID Verification** cross-references the live site's metadata with the latest commit in the GitHub repository. It even uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) re-verification** at the moment of deposit to ensure the buyer gets exactly what was advertised.

### 4. Automated Legal Compliance
*   **The Problem:** Most micro-sales ignore Intellectual Property (IP) transfer, leaving the buyer legally vulnerable.
*   **The Valyra Solution:** Every transaction includes an **On-Chain IP Assignment**. The seller signs a legal transfer agreement with their crypto wallet, and the hash of that agreement is permanently stored in the smart contract.

### 5. Dramatic Cost Reduction
*   **The Problem:** Professional brokers charge 15% fees and minimum retainers, which destroys the margins of small $5k–$10k deals.
*   **The Valyra Solution:** By replacing human brokers with AI and code, Valyra operates with a transparent **2.5% success fee**, making small exits financially viable.
